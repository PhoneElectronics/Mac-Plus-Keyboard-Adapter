# Mac-Plus-Keyboard-Adapter


So, I got my hands on a coouple of old Datadesk Mac-101 Keyboards, This is pre-ADB. Instead of doing the sensible thing and buying the adapter for USB for like 30 dollars, I made my own because I can.


Now it is free lol.


This Includes Support for Hot-Pluggability and will function as a normal adapter, however I made some changes to my keyboard, and physically cut the traces for the escape key, and 3 keypad keys that were not supported on the original mac. Normally when pressing these keys, the mac keyboard would send a key combination, rather than a single key (i.e. SHIFT+LEFT or SHIFT+RIGHT)


My keyboard does not work for BIOS yet, because the arduino keyboard library is limited,  This should be changed in the coming days and weeks.

More soon...
